                </h2>
                <p>Digital marketing for large companies is a different ballgame than it is for small, local businesses. With a wide audience and a vast offering, well-known, nationwide brands usually have over 500 pages to optimize, so it’s no wonder that SEO for huge websites can be daunting. However, where there is a will, there is a way, and we happen to be the experts. Here is a look at our top tips to SEO huge websites:

Create a Clear Long-Term Strategy
Before any SEO work should be attempted, creating a comprehensive long-term strategy is a must. By mapping out every aspect of your marketing plan, you can clearly see what you need to accomplish. Then, you can prioritize the list to make sure the most important SEO elements are completed first.

Complete One Section at a Time
Once you have a clear map to SEO large companies, break it down into sections. Look at how your website is naturally broken down, whether it is by services or product categories, and choose one area to begin with. Start with the one that makes the most ROI depending on what season it is and when that section gets the most attention.

Attack Title Tags Strategically
SEO tags should be the first item on your agenda. They tell the Google bots what each individual page is about and they are necessary if you want to rank. Start with the title tags, working your way through the most popular pages first and then tackling the less visited ones. Hint: Google Analytics is a great tool to determine where to start.

Focus on the Sales Funnel
Another vital tip to SEO large websites is to ensure that each page, and its keywords, coincides with the process of the sales funnel the visitor is at. Is the page’s purpose to provide information? Then use keywords that they might search to find that material. Is the page’s intention to convert them into a paying customer? Then choose keywords with buying words, such as “best price” and “where to buy”.

 

As long as you are methodical in your approach, your SEO efforts will pay off big time. At Zero Gravity Marketing, we are experts at SEO for large websites, and we would love to tackle yours.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>  You may be an avid YouTube watcher—many people are—which is why your brand should have a strong presence on the social media platform. Every day, videos on YouTube garner billions of views, and these views are not just about entertainment. Many people use YouTube as their go-to learning tool, and it’s time for your company to start teaching.

YouTube Can Boost Your Brand Reach
No matter what industry you are in, you are an expert in something: something that other people are not experts in. By incorporating YouTube SEO into your digital marketing strategy, you can reach the people that are seeking advice in your industry, and then build trust with them and convert them into customers. Here are the top three reasons why you should have a strong YouTube presence:

Step Up Your Engagement Level – As you know, building a relationship with your customers is half the battle. By using video to tell your story or demonstrate your product instead of simply relying on writing, you draw more people in, and keep them intrigued for longer.
Enjoy YouTube SEO Benefits – Yes, YouTube videos do show up in Google’s search results, so by making your presence known on the platform, you are giving yourself another opportunity to rank for your keywords.
Expand Your Reach – Once someone watches your YouTube video, you can then encourage them to subscribe to your channel or click through to your website, further increasing the amount of contact you get with them.
YouTube Optimization Is Vital
Just like with all things in the online space, if you don’t take the time and effort to optimize your content, it won’t be seen and you won’t be able to reap any of the aforementioned rewards for your efforts. Since Google bots do not watch videos, it’s your job to make sure they know exactly what you are talking about in them. Here’s how:

Use a Keyword in Your Title – Choose your main keyword and make sure to use it in your title, while still crafting a title that is enticing to the searcher.
Incorporate Tags with Discretion – As awesome as the tagging feature in YouTube is, you have to make sure you only include tags that are relevant to your video. YouTube rankings are all about how long people watch your video—not just how many people click on it—so if the content doesn’t match up to the query, your view times will be minuscule.
Take Advantage of the Description – Your video description is your chance to entice the viewer, yes, but it is also your opportunity to tell the algorithm exactly what the video is about. You should make the description several hundred words and include your keywords so it is easy to find for both Google’s and YouTube’s search engines.
Consider Transcription – While a thorough description is fantastic, a full transcript of your video underneath the description is even better. This gives your more chances to incorporate your keywords, while also giving the viewers the opportunity to learn from your video if they have to keep the volume off. And if you don’t want to do the transcription yourself, there are many transcription services that can do it for you for a very reasonable price.
YouTube is one of the hidden gems in the world of SEO. If you can use YouTube optimization efficiently, you can see an increase in traffic and conversions in record time. To learn more about how YouTube might work within your industry, contact us today.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Social media is here to stay. Research suggests that by 2018 there will be an estimated 2.67 billion social media users worldwide, with 1 million new active mobile users added each day. Social media has become an essential element of modern day business. There’s simply no better way to engage with customers, generate new leads, develop valuable user insights and build a strong digital presence.

More people are online than ever before. And with the average person signing up for more than five accounts across multiple social networks, businesses can quickly find themselves stretched trying to remain active on each platform. So how can you effectively manage your social media and see the results you’re looking for?

Social Media Management for Business

Develop a Social Media Strategy

Many businesses make the mistake of diving headfirst into social media without having any idea of what they are trying to achieve. Without a plan, you’ll find yourself spending hours treading water and going nowhere fast.

An effective social strategy should be combined and integrate into your broader business goals and objectives. Each social interaction should support and be guided by a bigger marketing plan. It’s important that your social media efforts aren’t going to waste.

So how do you develop a strong social media strategy? Start by understanding what social media can do for you. Do you want to increase brand awareness? Build a loyal following? Acquire leads and drive sales? By outlining clear goals, you can then set SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-based), and measure your success. An example may be, I want to increase Facebook page likes by 15% within three months of implementation.

A clear strategy with measurable objectives will make it much easier to analyse ROI (Return on Investment) and understand what is and isn’t working.

 

Stay Organised

There’s no doubt about it. Staying organised is essential if you're looking to build a strong social following on multiple platforms. Twitter engagement is generally at its highest with 3-5 posts per day, Facebook at 2 posts per day, Pinterest with 5+ pins and LinkedIn and Instagram at 1 post. To add further complexity, the times you post also impact your user engagement, and these differ between platforms as well as your target audience.

Switching to a social media management tool, such as BabbleHub, can drastically improve your productivity and help your marketing budget go that little bit further. Start monitoring and scheduling all your social activity from one place. BabbleHub offers advanced scheduling and integrates across the most popular social platforms- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest. With the ability to manage up to 100 profiles and an unlimited number of social media accounts, there’s no excuse not to be organised!

 

Focus on Quality Over Quantity

While it’s great to be active on social media, sub-par content posted just to meet your quota is going to disengage your followers quickly, and can also reflect poorly on your reputation. You want to make sure every social post contributes something of value, and can be re-shared, re-tweeted and passed on.

Delivering quality content on a regular basis can be a lot of work, and it’s easy to be overwhelmed. Creating a shareable resource such as a content calendar can help your marketing team stay on track and regularly produce quality content. Don’t stretch yourself too thin, if you’re finding it difficult to keep up, consider outsourcing to a dedicated social media content writer.

 

Analyse data

A lot of time, effort and money go into developing and deploying a social media strategy, so naturally, you want to know if it’s successful or not. Otherwise, what's the point?

Set aside ten to fifteen minutes each week to see how your social media metrics stack up against your goals and objectives. A social media management platform should provide you with all the data you need to measure your success. You can track how your audience engages with your content, how your recent campaign contributed to your sales, or which #hashtags are performing best.

 

Final Notes on Managing your Social Media

Social media may seem like an overwhelming task, but if you approach it in the right way and manage it effectively, it can do wonders for your business. Start off small, keep persisting and watch your following grow!</p>
